welcome  to my page！

🌱 My name is Qi, i am currently an undergraduate student pursing a second bachelor's in computer science.My first degree was in plant protection.（My teacher told me before " we are going to train you to become a Plant Doctor" but i konw that not a really docter,so i quit )

🤔 I upload my code from my studies to GitHub, as well as write articles in the issues section of GitHub to document the challenges, joys, difficulties, and insights I encounter during my learning process.

 👯 I enjoy communication and welcome any thoughts or ideas you may have, so please feel free to leave me a message. I enjoy writing and expressing myself through recording my thoughts, and I hope to quickly master the art of expressing myself through code.


🔭 I don't know who can read these in futher,maybe nobody. I don't know what should i write in this.....

👯 So， I just see this note,this github space, and all my repositories as my traces in the internet.

 Maybe some day,some one visit here, just say: Hi,there ,welecome here!
